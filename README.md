Notes written during the lecture are [here](./Lecture.pdf).

Figures used in the presentations were generated with [this notebook](./Figures.ipynb).

Books about molecular dynamics:
- Frenkel and Smit, Understanding Molecular Simulation.
- Tuckerman, Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation.

References about thermostats:
- Bussi and Parrinello, [PRE 2007](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.75.056707) for the way we showed how to integrate Langevin equations.
- Bussi, Donadio, and Parrinello, [JCP 2007](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2408420)
  and Bussi and Parrinello, [CPC](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2008.01.006) for stochastic velocity rescaling.

Reference about metadynamics (we didn't have time to go through this however):
- Bussi and Parrinello [Nat Rev Phys](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-020-0153-0).

Material about enhanced sampling, collective variables, etc.:
